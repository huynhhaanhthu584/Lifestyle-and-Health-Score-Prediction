# Lifestyle and Health Score Prediction

This project applies linear regression to explore how various lifestyle factors affect an individual's health score. Using a synthetic dataset, the analysis quantifies the relationships between health-related behaviors (e.g. sleep, alcohol use) and self-reported health outcomes.

---

## Objective

To predict health scores based on lifestyle indicators and identify which factors contribute most significantly to overall health.

---

## Methods

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and standardization
- Linear regression modeling using `lm()`
- Model performance evaluation (R², residual analysis)

## Technologies Used
- Language: R
- Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, readr, caret, broom

## Key Results
Identified strong correlations between health score and factors such as sleep duration and alcohol use.

Applied standardization and diagnostic plots to evaluate assumptions of linear regression.

Achieved interpretable model with decent predictive performance on synthetic data.
